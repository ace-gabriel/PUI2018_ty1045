# PUI2018_ty1045


This repo includes all homework and course materials from PUI class @ NYU Tandon 2018. 
General thoughts: this class is nice for introductory level spatial data analysis, as well as introductory level python programming exerciese. Overall it's a pleasure to work with Dr.Bianco through out the entire semester. One future improvement that comes to my mind is probably make the course more friendly to those who with little or no programming experiences.
